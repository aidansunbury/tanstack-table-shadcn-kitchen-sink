# Tanstack table kitchen sink

This example is built off of the [Tanstack Table Kitchen Sink Example](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/kitchen-sink) in the docs, but also includes [sticky column pinning](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/column-pinning-sticky).

More importantly, it is refactored to have a nice ui with shadcn components, and be styled with tailwindcss, instead of the example which uses native css.

One final important thing, is that is shows how to dynamically generate the table without having to hardcode the columns.
